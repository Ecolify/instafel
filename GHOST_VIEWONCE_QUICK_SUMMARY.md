# Ghost ViewOnce Patch Fix - Quick Summary

## What was fixed?

The Ghost ViewOnce patch was failing when it found **3 candidate smali files** instead of just one:
- `smali/X/5zl.smali`
- `smali/X/000.smali`  
- `smali/X/6gx.smali`

The patch couldn't decide which file to patch, so it failed completely.

## How was it fixed?

Implemented a **smart scoring system** that:

1. **Finds all candidates** - All files matching the search criteria
2. **Scores each candidate** - Based on method signatures and markers
3. **Selects the best one** - The highest-scoring file is used
4. **Applies the patch** - Only to the selected file

## Scoring Criteria

Each candidate file is scored based on:

| Feature | Points | Why? |
|---------|--------|------|
| Both marker strings in same method | +100 | Must have both `visual_item_seen` and `send_visual_item_seen_marker` |
| Method has 3 parameters, returns void | +50 | Matches InstaEclipse signature |
| Method is `static` | +10 | Preferred for utility methods |
| Method is `final` | +5 | Secondary preference |
| Contains "permanent" marker | +20 | View once permanence handling |
| Contains "replayed" marker | +15 | View once replay handling |

The file with the **highest total score** is selected for patching.

## What changed in the code?

### New Files
- `GHOST_VIEWONCE_FIX.md` - Full technical documentation (English)
- `GHOST_VIEWONCE_FIX_ES.md` - Full technical documentation (Spanish)

### Modified Files
- `FileSearchResult.kt` - Added `MultipleFound` result type
- `SearchUtils.kt` - Returns `MultipleFound` when multiple candidates exist
- `GhostViewOnce.kt` - Intelligent candidate selection with scoring
- 10 other patches - Handle `MultipleFound` case

### Total Changes
- 15 files modified
- ~200 lines added
- ~23KB of documentation

## Testing

✅ **Build:** patcher-core compiles successfully  
✅ **Code Review:** No issues found  
✅ **Security Scan:** No vulnerabilities detected  

## Based on InstaEclipse

This fix is based on the approach used by [InstaEclipse](https://github.com/ReSo7200/InstaEclipse), adapted for static smali patching instead of runtime hooking.

**InstaEclipse:** Hooks methods at runtime and validates dynamically  
**Instafel:** Scores candidates statically and patches the best match

## Documentation

- English: [GHOST_VIEWONCE_FIX.md](./GHOST_VIEWONCE_FIX.md)
- Spanish: [GHOST_VIEWONCE_FIX_ES.md](./GHOST_VIEWONCE_FIX_ES.md)

## Quick Start

The patch should now work automatically when you run:
```bash
./patcher run <work_directory> ghost_viewonce
```

Or to apply all Ghost Mode patches:
```bash
./patcher run <work_directory> ghost_mode
```
