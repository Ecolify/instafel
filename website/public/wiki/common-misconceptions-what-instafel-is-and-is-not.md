## ❌ Common Misconceptions: What Instafel Is and Is Not

Clarifying what Instafel does **not** do helps set correct user expectations:

- **No Media Downloading:** Instafel does not allow downloading stories, posts, reels, or any media content. This feature is not supported yet. The only provided download feature is what official Instagram does.
- **No Ghost Mode:** Stealth viewing or hiding seen statuses (“ghost mode”) is not available and never guaranteed in the app.  
- **No Font or Emoji Changes:** Font styles and emoji appearances depend on your device OS settings; Instafel cannot override these without root or system-level hacks.  
- **No Official Affiliation:** Instafel is an independent, community-driven project without official ties to Meta or Instagram.  
- **No Server Behavior Modification:** The app cannot fake or change server responses; it only exposes client-side features that Meta already included in Alpha builds.  
- **Not a Consumer App:** Instafel is designed for power users, testers, and developers interested in experimental Instagram features — it’s not intended for casual users or mass distribution. That does not mean that you cannot use Instafel if you are a casual user, but be careful. 
- **No Root Required:** You don’t need root to use Instafel.
