## ⚠️ Limitations & Warnings: Understanding the Risks of Using Instafel

While Instafel unlocks powerful experimental features, users must be aware of several important limitations and risks:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Instability:** Instagram Alpha builds are sometimes unstable. Even the official versions often crash or behave unexpectedly. Instafel cannot fix Instagram's bugs but only exposes hidden developer options.  
- **Flag-Related Issues:** Some feature flags can cause severe UI glitches, broken navigation, or instant crashes. It’s crucial to enable flags carefully and one at a time to isolate problems.  
- **Server-Dependent Flags:** Many flags depend on server-side activation. If the server disables a flag or experiment, enabling it locally may have no effect or cause inconsistent behavior.  
- **Data Loss Risk:** Improper flag toggling or corrupted backups can lead to app crashes or data loss. Always backup your current configuration before experimenting.  
- **No Official Support:** Instafel is a community-driven, unofficial client. It is not affiliated with Meta or Instagram and carries no guarantees regarding stability.
- **No Root Required, but Limited:** Instafel does not require root, but some deep modifications (e.g., font or emoji changes) require OS-level access, which Instafel cannot provide.  
- **No Piracy Features:** Instafel does not have any features that would enable media downloading, ghost mode, or content scraping.
