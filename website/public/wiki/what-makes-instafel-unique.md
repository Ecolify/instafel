## ✨ What Makes Instafel Unique?

Instafel isn’t just another modded Instagram client. It’s a purpose-built Alpha-based testing app focused on **feature exploration**, **developer access**, and **community-driven experimentation**.

---

### 🧪 Built on Real Instagram Alpha Releases

While many mods rely on old or Stable APKs, **Instafel always builds from the latest Alpha releases** distributed by Meta. This means:
- You’re using the most cutting-edge versions of the app.
- You get access to features *before* they reach Beta or Stable.
- Instafel mirrors the same environment Meta engineers use internally.

---

### 🔁 Fast and Frequent Updates

Instafel prioritizes speed and version freshness:
- Releases are updated as soon as new Alpha builds drop.
- Patching and testing is handled by a small, fast-moving team.
- OTA (Over-the-Air) updates make upgrading seamless and automated.

No more waiting weeks for a patch — new builds are often live within hours or some couple of days.

---

### ⚙️ Developer Options, Flags, and Menus — Fully Unlocked

Instafel **unlocks internal developer tools** normally hidden from the public:
- Developer Options panel
- Feature flag toggles
- Backup import/export tools
- Crash log reports
- UI experiments

You get to **see and control** what Meta usually hides.

### 🧬 No Ghost Mode, No Media Downloads — By Design

Unlike other Instagram mods, Instafel **doesn’t provide features like story downloading or ghost mode**:
- The focus is **on testing**, not cheating.
- We keep Instafel up-to-date, minimal, and true on purpose.

---

### 📚 Community-Driven Flag + Backup Libraries

Instafel includes:
- A **Flag Library** (documented feature toggles)
- A **Backup Library** (user-submitted flag setups)

These resources make it easier for users to safely explore features, replicate setups, and contribute to the ecosystem.

---

### 🤝 Transparency and Open Development

- The **patcher is open source** — anyone can build and audit Instafel.
- Updates, bugs, and changes are **logged and discussed openly**.
- The focus is on learning, not hiding.
