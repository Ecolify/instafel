**Instafel** is a project that aims to deliver the **latest alpha builds of Instagram** with **developer options enabled** — allowing users to explore Instagram's alpha features which is not released publicly yet.

Instafel is ideal for those who want early access to experimental features and enhanced control over Instagram.

## 🚀 How Instafel Works

The process behind Instafel is designed to be fast, efficient, and reliable:

1. **Alpha Builds Patched Instantly**  
   Using our Instafel patcher, we generate patched Instagram alpha builds with developer options enabled as soon as a new alpha version is released by Meta.

2. **Internal Testing**  
   Once a build is generated, it is passed on to our testing team. They ensure that everything works as expected and the build is safe to use.

3. **Automated Release**  
   After successful testing, the **Instafel Bot** automatically uploads the approved build to our official release channel — making it instantly accessible to users.
