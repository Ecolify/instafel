## 📱 What Is Instagram Alpha — And How Instafel Connects

Instagram Alpha is the most experimental and unstable development version of Instagram’s Android app. Unlike the Stable or Beta releases, Alpha builds are mainly used internally by Meta engineers to test unfinished features, UI changes, and backend experiments. These builds are being updated frequently and often include bugs, crashes, or incomplete functions. Normal users don’t have access to Alpha builds through official channels.

### 🔑 Server-Based Feature Flags

Instagram uses **server-controlled flags** to decide which features are enabled for each user or device. Even if a feature exists in the app code, it stays hidden unless the server activates its flag. This allows Meta to run tests and rollouts smoothly without new app versions.

### 🛠️ Developer Options & Hidden Tools

Inside Instagram Alpha, Meta employees can access hidden developer menus to toggle flags and debug features. Developer options is blocked to use from regular users by design.

### 🔎 What Instafel Does

Instafel is a modified Instagram Alpha client that **unlocks these hidden developer menus and feature flags** for regular users. It does not aim cheating (like hiding seen status) or content-downloading; instead, it’s a platform for:

- Exploring unreleased features  
- Testing experimental UI changes and flags  
- Understanding how Meta develops Instagram  
- Exporting and importing flag configs through backup files

Instafel patches official Alpha builds and distributes them with developer options fully accessible, plus added tools like backup import/export and OTA updates.

### ⚠️ What Instafel Is Not

- It does **not** enable downloading stories, reels, or posts  
- It does **not** provide stealth or “ghost mode” features  
- It does **not** override emojis or fonts (these are OS-controlled)  
- It does **not** modify server behavior—only exposes client-side local flags

### ⚙️ Using Instafel Means Accepting Instability

Alpha builds are sometimes buggy and it is possible to face crashes or unintended behaviours while using the app. Instafel cannot fix Instagram’s bugs which exist on Alpha ones, but it helps users explore new features safely by enabling some flags or using backups. Actually, Instafel is not meant to fix/modify anything related to Instagram's functions; Instafel only makes Alpha releases possible to use by you, as a casual user.
