### ðŸ‘¤ Who Can Contribute?

Youâ€™re welcome to share it!

### ðŸ“Œ What You Should Know Before Contributing

Contributing to the Backup Library isnâ€™t just about uploading a file â€” itâ€™s about helping others safely use experimental features. Hereâ€™s what to consider:

- **Test thoroughly:** Make sure your backup doesnâ€™t crash or break core app functions.
- **Be specific:** Give your backup a clear name and description.
- **Avoid dangerous flags:** Donâ€™t include unstable flags unless you're clearly warning users.

### ðŸ§¾ Optional (But Recommended)

If possible, include:
- A short **changelog or summary** of what your backup enables.
- Warnings or known bugs.
