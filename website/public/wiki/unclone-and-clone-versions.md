## üß¨ Clone & Unclone Explained

One of Instafel‚Äôs most powerful features is its support for **cloning**, allowing you to install multiple versions of the Instagram Alpha app side by side. This is particularly useful for users who want to avoid conflicts with the official Instagram app.

### üì¶ What Does ‚ÄúClone‚Äù Mean?

Cloning refers to modifying the app‚Äôs package name (and sometimes its digital signature) so that it can work with other Instagram-based apps on the same device. A cloned app behaves like a completely separate application:

- It has its own app data and cache
- You can run multiple setups with different feature flags in parallel  

This is especially valuable for power users and testers running experiments or comparing behaviors between builds.

### üõ†Ô∏è How Cloning Works in Instafel

When downloading or installing Instafel, you may see two different variants:

- **Unclone Version** (`com.instagram.android`)  
  - This version **replaces** the stock Instagram app  
  - Cannot be installed alongside the official app  
  - Useful for experiencing the original Instagram environment  

- **Clone Version** (`com.instafel.android`)  
  - Has a different package name, app name and app logo
  - Can be installed side by side with the original app
  - Safe for testing and experimental use  

You can install both types at once. For example:

- Use **stock Instagram** for daily use  
- Use **Instafel Clone** for exploring internal flags and unreleased features  

Or, you might want to use Unclone variant if you want Instafel to replace your official Instagram app.
