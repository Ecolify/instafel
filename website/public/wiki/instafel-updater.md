## 📲 Instafel Updater (Standalone App)

**Instafel Updater** is a lightweight, standalone Android application responsible for managing and installing new builds of the Instafel app. It works as the bridge between the patcher backend and the end-user, making it easier to stay up-to-date with the latest experimental Instagram Alpha releases — without needing to manually search for download links or APKs.

### 🧩 What Is Its Purpose?

The Instafel Updater is not a patcher itself — it does **not create builds**. Instead, it serves as an **installer and update manager** that:

- Downloads the latest pre-patched Instafel APKs
- Detects your currently installed variant (clone or unclone)
- Notifies you about updates
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Installs new builds with one tap (or it even can update it automatically with Shizuku-Root permission)

- Installs new builds with one tap

The builds it installs are generated and tested beforehand by the Instafel patcher and team.

### 🧬 Variant-Aware Behavior

The Updater intelligently checks whether you're using:

- The **clone** version (with custom package name), or
- The **unclone** version (the original package name, which is the same as the package name of Official Instagram app)

And then delivers the appropriate build to match your setup.

This ensures:

- You don’t install an incompatible version
- Your data and cache remain intact
- You can update without uninstalling

### 🛠️ Key Features

- ⚡ **Fast Build Delivery** — Direct download of the latest approved Instafel builds
- 🔄 **Seamless In-App Installation** — No need for external APK management
- 🧠 **Smart Variant Matching** — Clone users get clone builds, unclone users get unclone builds
- 🛡️ **Safe Updates** — Builds are tested and approved before they go live
- 📦 **Compact Size** — The updater itself is small and efficient

---

### ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

- The Updater does **not allow switching between clone/unclone.** That still requires manual uninstall/reinstall.
- If your current Instafel installation is broken, the Updater might not detect it. In such cases, a clean reinstall may be necessary.
- The app relies on the Instafel servers. If servers or the patcher backend are temporarily offline, updates may not be available temporarily.

### 📥 Where to Get It?
