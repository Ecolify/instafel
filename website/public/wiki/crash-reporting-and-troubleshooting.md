## üõ†Ô∏è Crash Reporting & Troubleshooting: How to Handle Issues in Instafel

Instafel provides some tools and recommended practices for managing crashes and bugs:

- **Crash Logs Collection:** Instafel can capture crash reports and you can send them directly to the development team to improve future releases.
- **Rollbacks:** If a new Instafel version causes crashes, revert to a previous stable release to maintain usability.
- **Backup Restore:** Use the old backup file to restore previously working flag configurations when new changes cause instability.
- **Wait for Fixes:** Some crashes result from server-side changes or Alpha bugs outside Instafel‚Äôs control ‚Äî waiting for updates is often necessary.
- **Clean Reinstall:** If persistent issues occur, uninstall Instafel completely and reinstall fresh to clear corrupted data or broken caches.
- **Provide Detailed Reports:** When seeking help, include logs, device info, and steps to reproduce the issue to speed up troubleshooting.
