## 💾 Exporting Backup Files: Save and Share Your Flag Configurations

Backups in Instafel are files that contain your current flag combination. You can export them to save your setup, share it with others, or restore it later if something breaks. These are especially useful when experimenting with unstable features.

### ⚠️ What to Be Careful About

- **Backup files are version-sensitive.** Flags change across app versions and different Instagram clients. A working backup on one version may break things in another.
- Don’t blindly share or apply backups unless you know what they do.
- **Export before experimenting.** If you plan to enable many flags, back up first so you can revert easily.

### 🧠 What Is the Flag Analyzer?

Instafel includes a **Flag Analyzer**—a tool that:
- Reads the flags in your backup.
- Shows which flags are **active**,
- Compares the backup with the current overrides,
- Helps you clean up unnecessary or redundant flags.

This makes backup creation more transparent and safer.

### 🛠️ Tips for Creating and Sharing Your Own Backups

- Give your backup a **descriptive name**, e.g., `ReelsTest_UI_V1.ibackup`.
- Add a **readme or text note** if you're sharing it — explain what the backup enables.
- Do not use special characters like #$£& or any other while creating the name of the backup or the changelog of your backup to avoid some unintended errors,
- Always test before sharing: make sure your backup doesn’t crash the app.
- Keep a personal “safe” backup that’s known to be stable.
