## 🚩 Flags and Backups

### 🔧 What Does Flags Mean?

Flags in Instagram are like an on/off switch controlled by Meta’s servers. Instead of sending new code every time, Instagram turns features on or off remotely using these flags, without an app update.

Instafel makes these flags inside the app accessible by users and lets you change them yourself. In this way, you can try out features even if Meta hasn’t officially released them to everyone. However, some features are completely server based and you cannot enable some experimental things without Meta's roll outs.

### 📚 Flag & Backup Libraries

To make using feature flags easier, Instafel provides two main libraries:

- **Flag Library:**  
  A searchable collection of known flags found in Alpha versions. Each flag includes a description, which parts of the app it affects, and the versions where it appears or starts to work.

- **Backup Library:**  
  Saved flag configurations (.JSON or .IBACKUP files) that can be imported directly. These backups activate pre-tested combinations of flags known to work well together or unlock specific features.

Users can:

- Save their current configuration as a backup
- Share backups with others
- Restore from a backup to revert to a known-good state

This enables community-based experimentation and shared discoveries.

### ⚠️ Warnings and Tips

- Some flags may **cause crashes or UI glitches**; enable with caution.
- Always **backup your current flag setup** before experimenting.
- Instafel app and Instafel Backups may receive updates; enable auto updates both for app and backup files for the best experience.

### 🚨 Risks and Limitations

Not all flags are safe to enable. Because these features are under active development:

- Some flags may **crash the app** immediately.
- Others may **break navigation or layouts**.
- A few flags are **server-dependent** and won’t activate locally without server response.

Instafel does **not fake** server responses; it only allows local control over flags already built into the APK.
