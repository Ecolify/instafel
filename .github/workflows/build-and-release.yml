# This workflow builds the Instafel Android app, uploads APKs as artifacts, and creates releases
#
# Triggers:
# - Push to main branch: Builds APKs and uploads as artifacts
# - Push tags (v*): Builds APKs, uploads artifacts, and creates a GitHub release
# - Pull requests to main: Builds APKs for testing
# - Manual dispatch: Can be triggered manually from the Actions tab
#
# Artifacts: 
# - Debug and release APKs are uploaded as artifacts and retained for 30 days
# - APK filenames include the commit hash for easy identification
#
# Releases:
# - When a tag matching 'v*' is pushed, a GitHub release is automatically created
# - Both debug and release APKs are attached to the release
# - Release notes are auto-generated from commits
