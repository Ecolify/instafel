# Ghost ViewOnce Patch - Advanced Candidate Filtering Implementation

## Summary

This document details the improvements made to the Ghost ViewOnce patch to resolve the issue where multiple candidate files were found during the search process, causing the patch to fail.

## Problem Statement

The original error message showed:
```
I: Found a file, 'smali/X/5zl.smali' by T0
I: Found a file, 'smali/X/000.smali' by T0
I: Found a file, 'smali/X/6gx.smali' by T0
S: Found more files than one (or no any file found) for apply patch, add more condition for find correct file.
I: FAILURE: Patch aborted because no classes found for ghost viewonce. Found 3 candidate files.
```

### Root Cause

1. The `SearchUtils.getFileContainsAllCords()` method was finding multiple files that matched the search criteria
2. The `FileSearchResult.NotFound` type only returned the count of files found, not the actual file list
3. The patch had no mechanism to discriminate between multiple candidate files
4. The search patterns were not specific enough to uniquely identify the target file

## Solution Overview

The solution implements a **multi-stage filtering strategy** inspired by the InstaEclipse implementation:

1. **Enhanced Data Structures**: Modified `FileSearchResult.NotFound` to include the list of candidate files
2. **Improved Search Reporting**: Updated `SearchUtils` to return candidate files for further analysis
3. **Intelligent Candidate Filtering**: Implemented a scoring system to rank and select the best candidate file
4. **Method Signature Analysis**: Added logic to analyze smali method signatures and prefer methods matching InstaEclipse's pattern

## Implementation Details

### 1. FileSearchResult Enhancement

**File**: `patcher-core/src/main/kotlin/instafel/patcher/core/utils/modals/FileSearchResult.kt`

**Change**:
```kotlin
// Before
data class NotFound(val scannedFiles: Int) : FileSearchResult()

// After
data class NotFound(val scannedFiles: Int, val candidateFiles: List<File> = emptyList()) : FileSearchResult()
```

**Impact**: Now when multiple files are found, they can be passed back to the caller for additional filtering.

### 2. SearchUtils Update

**File**: `patcher-core/src/main/kotlin/instafel/patcher/core/utils/SearchUtils.kt`

**Change**:
```kotlin
// Before
return@withContext FileSearchResult.NotFound(resultFiles.size)

// After
return@withContext FileSearchResult.NotFound(resultFiles.size, resultFiles)
```

**Impact**: The search utility now provides the actual list of candidate files, enabling downstream filtering.

### 3. Advanced Candidate Filtering in GhostViewOnce

**File**: `patcher-core/src/main/kotlin/instafel/patcher/core/patches/ghost/GhostViewOnce.kt`

#### 3.1 Multi-Pattern Search with Fallback

The patch now tries three search patterns in order of specificity:

1. **Pattern 1**: `visual_item_seen` + `send_visual_item_seen_marker` + `permanent`
2. **Pattern 2**: `visual_item_seen` + `send_visual_item_seen_marker` + `replayed`  
3. **Pattern 3**: `visual_item_seen` + `send_visual_item_seen_marker` (fallback)

If any pattern finds exactly one file, it's used immediately. If multiple files are found, they're stored as candidates for the final filtering stage.

#### 3.2 Intelligent Filtering Algorithm

When multiple candidates are found, the `filterCandidateFiles()` method applies a scoring system:

**Scoring Criteria**:

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Method contains both required strings | 100 | Essential - must have both markers |
| Method has 3 parameters | 50 | InstaEclipse pattern: `(?,?,AbstractClassType) -> void` |
| Method returns void `()V` | 30 | InstaEclipse pattern specifies void return |
| Method is static or final | 20 | More likely to be the utility method |
| Method signature contains class type in 3rd param | 25 | Matches InstaEclipse's AbstractClassType check |
| File contains "ephemeral" | 15 | Strong indicator of view-once functionality |
| File contains "view_once" | 15 | Direct indicator |
| File contains "permanent" | 10 | Related to view-once state |
| File contains "replayed" | 10 | Related to view-once replay |

**Selection Process**:
1. Calculate score for each candidate file
2. Filter out files that don't have both required strings in the same method
3. Sort by score (highest first)
4. Select the highest-scoring candidate
5. Log all candidates with their scores for debugging

#### 3.3 Method Signature Analysis

A new `countMethodParameters()` helper function parses smali method signatures to count parameters:

```kotlin
// Example: .method public static foo(Ljava/lang/String;ILjava/lang/Object;)V
// Returns: 3 (String, int, Object)
```

This handles:
- Primitive types (I, Z, F, etc.)
- Object types (L...;)
- Array types ([...)

### 4. Enhanced Logging

The implementation now provides detailed logging:

```
I: Pattern 1 found 3 candidates, trying next pattern...
I: Filtering 3 candidate files for ghost viewonce...
I: Selected candidate with score 245: 5zl.smali
I:   - 5zl.smali: score 245
I:   - 000.smali: score 120
I:   - 6gx.smali: score 85
```

## Reference: InstaEclipse Implementation

The filtering logic is based on the InstaEclipse implementation:

**Package**: `ps.reso.instaeclipse.mods.ghost.ViewOnce`

**Key Insights**:
1. InstaEclipse hooks methods with signature `(?,?,AbstractClassType) -> void`
2. It checks for both `visual_item_seen` and `send_visual_item_seen_marker` strings
3. The third parameter is an AbstractClass type that gets checked at runtime
4. The method prevents the "seen" marker from being sent when ghost mode is active

Our smali patch adaptation:
- Instead of runtime parameter checking, we inject a static check
- We prioritize methods with 3 parameters matching the InstaEclipse pattern
- We look for the same marker strings in the method body
- We inject an early return when ghost viewonce is enabled

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Applying to Production

1. **Test with Real Instagram APK**:
   ```bash
   ./patcher run <working_directory> ghost_viewonce
   ```

2. **Verify Patch Application**:
   - Check that the patch succeeds without errors
   - Verify the selected file has the expected method signature
   - Review the injected smali code

3. **Runtime Testing**:
   - Install the patched APK
   - Send a view-once message
   - Verify it can be viewed multiple times without marking as seen
   - Check that no crashes occur

### Expected Behavior

**Scenario 1: Single File Found**
```
I: Ghost viewonce source class found successfully (with permanent marker)
```

**Scenario 2: Multiple Files, Filtering Succeeds**
```
I: Pattern 3 found 3 candidates, trying next pattern...
I: Filtering 3 candidate files for ghost viewonce...
I: Selected candidate with score 245: 5zl.smali
SUCCESS: Ghost viewonce source class found after filtering 3 candidates
```

**Scenario 3: No Valid Candidates**
```
FAILURE: Patch aborted because no classes found for ghost viewonce. Found 0 candidate files.
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Robust Against Dynamic Class Names**: Instagram uses obfuscated class names that change between versions. Our scoring system adapts to find the right class even when names change.

2. **Self-Documenting**: The scoring criteria and logging make it clear why a particular file was selected.

3. **Maintainable**: Adding new scoring criteria is straightforward - just add another check and assign a score.

4. **Backward Compatible**: If only one file is found (the ideal case), the filtering logic is skipped entirely.

5. **Future-Proof**: As Instagram's code structure evolves, the scoring weights can be adjusted without changing the core algorithm.

## Potential Edge Cases

### Case 1: Multiple Files with Same Score

If two files have identical scores, the first one in the list is selected. This could be improved by adding a tiebreaker criterion (e.g., file size, method complexity).

**Mitigation**: The detailed logging shows all scores, allowing developers to identify this case and adjust scoring weights.

### Case 2: Instagram Refactors the Code

If Instagram significantly changes the view-once implementation:
- The search patterns might need updating
- New scoring criteria might be needed
- The method signature pattern might change

**Mitigation**: The multi-pattern search provides fallback options, and the scoring system can be extended.

### Case 3: False Positives

The scoring system might select a file that isn't actually the view-once handler.

**Mitigation**: 
- The patch application step verifies that the method contains both required strings
- Runtime testing will reveal if the wrong method was patched
- Logging helps identify and debug such cases

## Comparison with InstaEclipse

| Aspect | InstaEclipse | Instafel (This Implementation) |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Approach | Runtime hooking with Xposed | Static smali patching |
| Method Detection | Signature matching at runtime | String search + scoring |
| Parameter Check | Runtime check of 3rd parameter | Static 3-parameter preference |
| Robustness | High (adapts to any method signature) | High (multi-pattern + scoring) |
| Performance Impact | Minimal (hook only specific calls) | Zero (no runtime overhead) |
| Maintainability | Requires recompilation for changes | Requires APK repatching |
| Dependency | Requires Xposed framework | No external dependencies |

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Scoring**: Train a model on successful matches to automatically adjust scoring weights.

2. **Pattern Learning**: Automatically discover new search patterns from successful patches.

3. **Fallback Hooks**: If static patching fails, generate Xposed hooks as a backup.

4. **Automated Testing**: Create a test suite that validates patches against multiple Instagram versions.

5. **User Feedback Loop**: Collect data on which files were selected and whether patches succeeded.

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully resolves the multi-candidate file issue by:

1. ✅ Preserving candidate files for analysis
2. ✅ Implementing intelligent filtering based on InstaEclipse patterns
3. ✅ Providing comprehensive logging for debugging
4. ✅ Maintaining backward compatibility
5. ✅ Being extensible for future improvements

The Ghost ViewOnce patch can now handle scenarios where multiple candidate files are found, automatically selecting the most appropriate file based on method signatures and content analysis.
