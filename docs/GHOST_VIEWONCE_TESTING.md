# Ghost ViewOnce Patch - Testing and Validation Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to test and validate the Ghost ViewOnce patch fix that resolves the "multiple candidate files" error.

## What Was Fixed

The patch now correctly identifies and patches the Instagram method that sends "visual_item_seen" markers. Previously, it failed with:
```
I: FAILURE: Patch aborted because no classes found for ghost viewonce. Found 3 candidate files.
```

Now it uses intelligent filtering to find the correct file (5nc.smali) among multiple candidates.

## How to Test

### 1. Build Verification

First, ensure the patcher builds successfully:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/instafel/instafel
./gradlew :patcher-core:build
```

**Expected output:**
- `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`
- No compilation errors
- All patches handle `MultipleFound` case

### 2. Patch Application Testing

To test the actual patching process, you would need to:

1. **Decompile an Instagram APK** (already done in `instagram/` directory)
2. **Run the patcher** to apply patches
3. **Check the logs** for Ghost ViewOnce patch status

**Expected log output:**
```
I: Loading tasks..
I: 2 task loaded
I: Executing tasks...
I: Execute: Find ghost viewonce source file
I: Totally 133059 file got listed in X folder(s)
I: Found a file, 'smali/X/5nc.smali' by T0
I: Ghost viewonce source class found with KHI reference: 5nc.smali
I: Execute: Apply ghost viewonce patch
I: Ghost viewonce patch successfully applied to method at line 88
```

### 3. Code Inspection

After patching, verify the changes in the target file:

```bash
# View the patched method
grep -A 20 "\.method.*Fe3" instagram/smali/X/5nc.smali
```

**Expected to see:**
```smali
.method public final bridge synthetic Fe3(LX/2vp;LX/Qff;LX/5eh;)V
    .locals 10

    # Ghost ViewOnce - Block view once seen markers
    invoke-static {}, Linstafel/app/utils/ghost/GhostModeManager;->isGhostViewOnceEnabled()Z
    move-result v0
    if-eqz v0, :ghost_viewonce_continue
    return-void
    :ghost_viewonce_continue

    .line 0
    check-cast p3, LX/5nb;
    ...
```

### 4. Runtime Testing

To test in a real Instagram app:

1. **Build the patched APK**
   - Compile the modified smali code back to APK
   - Sign the APK
   - Install on device

2. **Enable Ghost ViewOnce**
   - Open Instafel settings
   - Navigate to Ghost Mode
   - Enable "Ghost ViewOnce"

3. **Test functionality**
   - Have someone send you a "view once" photo/video
   - Open the message in Instagram
   - Verify:
     - ✅ You can view the media
     - ✅ Sender does NOT see "Seen" status
     - ✅ Message remains viewable (not deleted)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Patch still finds multiple files

**Possible causes:**
- Instagram version has different structure
- Search patterns need adjustment

**Solution:**
1. Check which files are found:
   ```bash
   grep -r "visual_item_seen" instagram/smali*/X/*.smali | grep -v "Binary"
   ```
2. Manually inspect candidates
3. Adjust filtering criteria if needed

### Issue: Method not found in target file

**Possible causes:**
- Instagram changed method name/signature
- Different obfuscation in this version

**Solution:**
1. Search for alternative patterns:
   ```bash
   grep -n "LX/KHI;" instagram/smali/X/5nc.smali
   ```
2. Look for methods calling KHI with visual_item_seen
3. Update search pattern in GhostViewOnce.kt

### Issue: Patched app crashes on viewing view-once media

**Possible causes:**
- Incorrect register usage in injected code
- Wrong method patched
- Syntax error in smali code

**Solution:**
1. Check logcat for errors:
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep -i "ghost\|viewonce\|instafel"
   ```
2. Verify injected code syntax
3. Ensure GhostModeManager class exists and is accessible

## Performance Considerations

The improved implementation uses memory-efficient operations:

- `file.useLines { it.count() }` - Counts lines without loading entire file
- `file.useLines { lines -> lines.any { ... } }` - Searches line-by-line
- Avoids `file.readText()` and `file.readLines()` for large files

This is especially important when:
- Processing 133,059+ smali files
- Some files are 100k+ lines (like 6oh.smali)
- Running on systems with limited memory

## Next Steps

After successful validation:

1. **Monitor for issues** with different Instagram versions
2. **Update patterns** if Instagram changes obfuscation
3. **Add automated tests** with sample smali files
4. **Document version compatibility** (which Instagram versions work)
