# Ghost Mode Menu Fix

## Issue Summary

The ghost mode menu had incorrect behavior where:
1. Sub-options (ghost_seen, ghost_typing, ghost_screenshot, ghost_viewonce, ghost_story, ghost_live) were always visible regardless of the main ghost_mode toggle state
2. NetworkInterceptor was not properly tied to the ghost_mode master switch
3. When ghost_mode was disabled, individual ghost features could still be active

## Problem Statement

From the issue description:
- When ghost_mode is activated, it should automatically show the options for ghost_live, ghost_seen, etc.
- NetworkInterceptor is NOT a switch - it's a function/dependency that activates when the ghost_mode switch is ON
- When ghost_mode switch is OFF, all ghost mode patches in the configuration menu should be hidden and disabled

## Solution Implemented

### 1. UI Visibility Control (`ifl_a_ghost_mode.java`)

#### Added Master Toggle Control
- The main ghost_mode switch now controls visibility of all sub-options
- When ghost_mode is **ON**: All sub-options become visible
- When ghost_mode is **OFF**: All sub-options are hidden (View.GONE)

#### Key Methods Added

**`initializeTileReferences()`**
- Initializes references to all 12 tile views (6 ghost features + 6 quick toggles)
- Enables centralized visibility management

**`setupGhostModeFeatures()`**
- Sets up all switch listeners for individual ghost features
- Maintains the existing functionality of each feature toggle

**`updateGhostModeOptionsVisibility(boolean isEnabled)`**
- Shows or hides all ghost mode sub-options based on master toggle
- Sets visibility to `View.VISIBLE` when enabled, `View.GONE` when disabled

**`disableAllGhostFeatures()`**
- Automatically disables all individual ghost features when master toggle is turned OFF
- Prevents ghost features from being active when main toggle is off
- Updates both the manager flags and preference storage
- Updates UI switch states to reflect disabled state

### 2. NetworkInterceptor Enhancement (`NetworkInterceptor.java`)

#### Master Toggle Check
Added a primary check in `shouldBlockRequest()`:
```java
if (!GhostModeManager.isEnabled()) {
    return false;
}
```

This ensures NetworkInterceptor is **completely inactive** when ghost mode is disabled.

#### Feature-Specific Checks
Updated all feature checks to use `isFeatureActive()` which verifies:
1. Ghost mode master toggle is ON
2. The specific feature toggle is ON

#### Added Missing Features
- **Ghost Seen**: Blocks DM read receipt tracking (`/direct_v2/threads/.../items/...mark_as_seen`)
- **Ghost Typing**: Blocks typing indicator (`/direct_v2/threads/.../activity_indicator_seen/`)

### 3. GhostModeManager Enhancement (`GhostModeManager.java`)

#### Added New Methods

**`isEnabled()`**
- Returns the state of the master ghost_mode toggle
- Used by NetworkInterceptor to check if it should be active

**`isFeatureActive(boolean featureFlag)`**
- Checks both master toggle AND individual feature toggle
- Ensures features only work when ghost mode is enabled
- Used by NetworkInterceptor for all URI blocking decisions

## Technical Details

### Visibility Management Flow

1. **On Activity Creation**:
   - Load ghost mode flags from preferences
   - Initialize all tile references
   - Set up main toggle with listener
   - Set initial visibility based on saved ghost_mode state
   - Set up all feature toggles

2. **When Main Toggle Changes**:
   - Update `GhostModeManager.isGhostModeEnabled`
   - Save to preferences
   - Update visibility of all sub-options
   - If disabled: Automatically disable all features
   - Show toast with "Network Interceptor Active" when enabled

3. **When Individual Feature Toggle Changes**:
   - Update corresponding `GhostModeManager` flag
   - Save to preferences
   - Feature only activates if master toggle is also ON

### NetworkInterceptor Logic Flow

```
Request comes in
    ↓
Check if GhostModeManager.isEnabled()
    ↓ NO → Allow request
    ↓ YES
Check URI path/query
    ↓
Check if GhostModeManager.isFeatureActive(feature)
    ↓ YES → Block request (return fake URI)
    ↓ NO → Allow request
```

## Files Modified

1. **`app/src/main/java/instafel/app/activity/ifl_a_ghost_mode.java`**
   - Added visibility control logic
   - Added helper methods for managing sub-options
   - Enhanced main toggle listener

2. **`app/src/main/java/instafel/app/utils/ghost/GhostModeManager.java`**
   - Added `isEnabled()` method
   - Added `isFeatureActive(boolean)` method

3. **`app/src/main/java/instafel/app/utils/ghost/NetworkInterceptor.java`**
   - Added master toggle check
   - Updated all feature checks to use `isFeatureActive()`
   - Added Ghost Seen URI blocking
   - Added Ghost Typing URI blocking
   - Enhanced documentation

## Testing

### Build Status
✅ Gradle build successful (`./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`)
✅ No compilation errors
✅ All dependencies resolved correctly

### Expected Behavior

1. **When Ghost Mode Toggle is OFF**:
   - All sub-options are hidden from view
   - All individual features are disabled
   - NetworkInterceptor does not block any requests
   - Toast shows: "Ghost Mode Disabled"

2. **When Ghost Mode Toggle is ON**:
   - All sub-options become visible
   - User can enable individual features
   - NetworkInterceptor becomes active
   - Toast shows: "Ghost Mode Enabled - Network Interceptor Active"

3. **When Individual Feature is Toggled**:
   - Only works if master toggle is ON
   - Feature preference is saved
   - NetworkInterceptor blocks/allows requests based on feature state

## Reference Implementation

This implementation follows the pattern used in InstaEclipse:
- `ps/reso/instaeclipse/utils/ghost/GhostModeUtils.java`
- `ps/reso/instaeclipse/utils/feature/FeatureFlags.java`

Key differences:
- Instafel uses Android UI visibility management
- Instafel uses PreferenceManager for persistence
- Instafel uses TileLargeSwitch custom UI components

## Conclusion

The ghost mode menu now correctly:
- ✅ Shows sub-options only when ghost mode is enabled
- ✅ Hides sub-options when ghost mode is disabled
- ✅ Automatically disables features when master toggle is OFF
- ✅ NetworkInterceptor is properly tied to master toggle
- ✅ Prevents ghost features from being active independently
- ✅ Provides clear user feedback via Toast messages
